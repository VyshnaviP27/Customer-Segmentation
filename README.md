### Data Collection and Cleaning:

1.Gather mall customers data including Gender, age, income, spending score(1-100)

### RFM Analysis:
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis is a customer segmentation technique used to identify and rank customers based on their purchasing behavior. It's especially popular in marketing and customer retention strategies.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between variables.
Determine the RFM from the data and use the K-Means to cluster the data.  

## Expected Outcome:

  2.Insightful visualizations of grouping customers on basis of age and their spending score, age and annual income and spending-score - annual come.
